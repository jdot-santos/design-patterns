# What is the abstract factory pattern?

The abstract factory is a group of similar factories that utilizes interfaces, subclasses, composition, and general software contracts to develop this pattern and achieve various levels of abstraction. It's similar to the factory method pattern, as it's typically implemented as a factory of factory patterns. 

Abstract factories are typically written as a framework pattern, meaning that it's part of a larger framework inside of the codebase. This is where the abstract factory pattern is different than other creational design patterns, because other patterns just focuses on a particular problem and do it in a generic way that we can use it anywhere in our code -- whereas the abstract factory is typically built with supporting a larger framework in mind. 

The abstract factory hides what factories it's using and also abstracts the environment being built through composition.
